# Unavailable.at

This app connects to a user's Google Calendar account and returns a
listing of what time's they're availabile for a given date range. I
found myself doing this manually quite often, so I made a small app to
do it for me.

## Setup

* Node.js >= 0.10
* Redis >= 2.4
* Grunt 0.4

`config/default.js` and `config/production.js` are not checked into the
repo. Take a look at `config/config-example.js` for what should go in
there.
